    1) copy constructor called
        source obj passed to constructor
    2) copy all static, non-pointed to data (such as size and space)

    3) copy pointed to data from source to destination (elem)
        use new operator to dynamiccaly allocate data (elem = new double*)
        initialize dynamic data
    4) if copy ASSIGNMENT, free the pointed-to data that already exists (using delete)
